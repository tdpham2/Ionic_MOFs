# Workflows for ionic Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)

This repository contains workflows related to the determination and solvent removal in MOFs. Main componenets:
- Ionic_MOF_determination_workflow.ipynb details the process to obtain ionic (cationic/anionic) MOFs from CSD non-disorder MOF subset.
- Solvent_removal_workflow.ipynb details the process to remove solvent/ions from MOFs crystal structure, as well as to compare the chemical formula of the frameworks with the experimental chemical formula

# Dependencies
- Networkx 3.1 (or later)
- ASE 3.22.1 (or later)
